    <h2 style="text-align: left;">An Amatuer Enthusist</h2>

      <p class="intro" style="margin-left: 7%; margin-right: 7%;">Beyond the professional identity of a mechanical engineer lies the pursuit of speed. Mario channels his zest for competition through endurance racing in the <a href="https://24hoursoflemons.com/" style="color: #139608;">24 Hours of Lemons</a>. Behind the wheel of a race car he runs laps twice a year to push the boundaries of his capabilities.</p>

<p>Discovering the gateway to the 24 Hours of Lemons and attending for the first time as a spectator was love at first sight. After that first trip he transformed from spectator to participant, assembling a team and roaring onto the racetrack for the first time in December 2011.</p>

<p>Beyond his need for speed he collects Coke cans from around the globe, a testament to his journeys and a minor hobby for him when he travels. Another hobby long passed, but still in the recess of memories are days working with model rockets something he still reflects on to this day.</>

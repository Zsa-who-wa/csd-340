      <p class="intro" style="margin-left: 7%; margin-right: 7%;"><p>Mario’s desire to comprehend how things work and how to make them better resonated at the core of his being even as a young man which fueled his interest in becoming an engineer. Earning a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and embarking on a lifelong career that has taken him around the world.</p>
<p>Dedicating his first decade to light manufacturing as a facility engineer, the nuances of optimizing processes, ensuring seamless operations and breathing life into the mechanisms that formed the backbone of production was his focus. Later this expanded into the sprawling landscape of Oil & Gas EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction). Finally, he was immersed in the details of Instrument and Controls Engineering where precision and finesse is vital.</p> 
<p>The unique challenges and exploration of solutions to resolve complex issues involving research, innovation and financial pragmatism excites him. Enjoying the freedom to develop projects without the constraint of constant approval and witnessing the fruits of labor years down the road fuels his motivation.</p>
<p>A significant journey unfurled for him when he was chosen to oversee the Instrument & Controls Commissioning for a monumental Gas Project in the far reaches of Australia. This opportunity led him to live and work in the heart of Singapore for a year and a half building relationships and experiences like no other.</p>
<p>Even today, the allure of engineering still captivates him and given the option to choose another career, he would choose engineering again channeling his energies towards management. This way he could have more influence over the technical facets of projects and better shape the outcomes on a broader scale.</p>
<p>As practical as he may be there still holds mysteries out there for him. Like the thought that aliens may exist, “but the universe is so vast, we have never or will never meet them.” Or if a genie asked what his three wishes would be – “The ability to understand everything in the universe, the ability to be immortal (from disease or injury) and the ability to cure any illness or injury in others.”</p>
<p>Mario’s body may be firmly planted on the ground, but his mind continues to be fascinated with the realm of possibilities.</p>
